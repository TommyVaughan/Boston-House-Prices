# Boston-House-Prices
In this assessment I plan to upload and view the Boston House Prices dataset and analyse using descriptive statistics and plots. I will also use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in the median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren't. Finally I hope to use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. The project can be viewed by selecting the Machine Learning & Statistics - Boston House Prices.ipynb file.
