# Boston-House-Prices
In this assessment I plan to upload and view the Boston House Prices dataset and analyse using descriptive statistics and plots. I will also use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in the median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren't. Finally I hope to use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. The project can be viewed by selecting the Machine Learning & Statistics - Boston House Prices.ipynb file.

In this file you will see the notebook laid out as follows

1) A description of the Python libraries used to help with the assignment.

2) A description of the Boston House Prices dataset explaining what it is and what the variables are.

3) A look at the descriptive statistics of the dataset.

4) Selecting a smaller number of variables to have a closer look at their distributions and relationships.

5) Using inferential statistics to examine if there is a significant difference in the median house prices between houses on and off the Charles River. 

6) Create a neural network using keras that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.

7) Conclusions on the assignment.

8) A list of the references used in completing the assignment.
